Sreeni Kanna (Empl ID: 0315940) needs a report that obtains all resources (both FTE and contractors) 
who have been on his time over the last three years, specifically August 2022 to present, including hire and termination dates.



@Jacob Perry, I suggest the report include the following fields:
EMPL ID, NAME, JOB CODE, JOB TITLE, HIRE DT, TERM DT

You will be using the following dbos from HRDataMart.
[HCMSECPROD1,50200].[HRDBPRD].[PSHRMS].[PS_JOB]
HRDataMart.hcm.DIM_JOBCODE_TOS_VW
Possibly:
[HCMSECPROD1,50200].HRDBPRD.PSHRMS.PS_POSITION_DATA

Other Info:

To pull on all TMs who have reported to Sreeni Kana, there where clause would be: WHERE REPORTS_TO = '00003160' (This is Sreeni's Position Number - all corp team members are in Position Management)

You will need to pull the TOS record for each Team Member in list, if TM reported to Sreeni during multiple employment periods, then that TM would have a record for each employment period in the results.
